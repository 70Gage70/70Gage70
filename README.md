### Hi, I'm Gage!

I'm a postdoctoral associate working in the [nonlinear dynamics group](https://nonlinear.earth.miami.edu/people/index.html) at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami. Currently, we are studying [_Sargassum_](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/sargassum.html) transport in the North Atlantic using physical and probabilistic models as well as interpretable machine learning techniques. I'm interesting in scientific computing, especially with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language.

I obtained my PhD from the University of Madison-Wisconsin in mathematical physics.

### Highlights

- [Sargassum.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/Sargassum.jl) A fully featured *Sargassum* toolkit written in Julia, including physics and biology simulation, satellite data analysis and a zero-code interface.

- [UlamMethod.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/UlamMethod.jl) A package for discretizing trajectory data into a transition probability matrix using Ulam's method. It has been applied to undrogued drifter motion in the North Atlantic to study the motion of Sargassum.

- [TransitionPathTheory.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/TransitionPathTheory.jl) A package which calculates basic and advanced statistics of transition path theory (TPT). These TPT statistics reveal new information about how a Markov process travels from a source to a target.

- [Kneedle.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/Kneedle.jl) Find the "knee" (corner) in a dataset `(x, y)`, e.g. to find the optimal thresholding parameter in a sparse regression problem.
