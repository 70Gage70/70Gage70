### Hi, I'm Gage!

I'm a postdoctoral associate working in the [nonlinear dynamics group](https://nonlinear.earth.miami.edu/people/index.html) at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami. Currently, we are studying [_Sargassum_](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/sargassum.html) transport in the North Atlantic using physical and probabilistic models. I'm interesting in scientific computing, especially with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language.

I obtained my PhD from the University of Madison-Wisconsin in mathematical physics.

### Open-source Scientific Projects

- [UlamMethod.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/UlamMethod.jl) A Julia package for discretizing trajectory data into a transition probability matrix using Ulam's method. It has been applied to undrogued drifter motion in the North Atlantic to study the motion of Sargassum.

- [TransitionPathTheory.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/TransitionPathTheory.jl) A Julia package which calculates basic and advanced statistics of transition path theory (TPT). These TPT statistics reveal new information about how a Markov process travels from a source to a target.

- [SargassumFromAFAI.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/SargassumFromAFAI.jl) (Coming soon!) A Julia package for computing Sargassum distributions from AFAI (Alternate Floating Algae Index) data. This provides easy access to datasets appropriate for testing models against qualitatively accurate distributions.

### Other Tools

- [WorldPolygonPlots](https://github.com/70Gage70/WorldPolygonPlots) A Mathematica/Wolfram Language package for creating high quality plots of densities supported on geopolygons.

- [SimplyPolyIntersect.jl](https://github.com/70Gage70/SimplePolyIntersect.jl) A Julia package for quickly and easily computing the intersection between two polygons.
